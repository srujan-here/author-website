Threads of Light, my debut novel, goes back to that formative terrain—adolescence—where identities are fragile, emotions arrive without instruction manuals, and small moments leave lifelong imprints.

The book is not about grand victories or dramatic rebellions. It is about the quiet struggles:
- wanting to belong but not knowing how,
- loving deeply before learning emotional boundaries,
- navigating failure, reputation, and reinvention while still figuring out who you are.

Set in the familiar world of Indian schools and tuitions, Threads of Light follows Vid—a boy learning, often painfully, that growing up is less about becoming stronger and more about learning how to hold one’s fractures with dignity. Around him are friendships that save, relationships that confuse, and choices that echo longer than expected.

Why write this story now?

Because many of us who appear “sorted” today are still carrying unresolved versions of our younger selves. Because the leaders we become are shaped long before titles and KPIs—often in corridors, classrooms, and stolen conversations. And because adolescence, in hindsight, is where we first learn that every shadow does hide a spark, even when we cannot yet see it.

Threads of Light is for anyone who remembers being seventeen. For anyone who once tried to be brave before knowing what bravery meant. And for anyone who believes that becoming whole is not about erasing the past—but understanding it.

I hope it finds its way to readers who recognise a piece of themselves in its pages.
